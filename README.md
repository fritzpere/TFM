# The Brain Network of Motivation: A Topological Approach

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive degeneration and specific motor symptomatology, consistent with a lesser than normal motor invigoration. However, it still remains to determine whether they are a consequence of a motor system weakening, or whether by contrast, its origin is more of a motivational nature, since motivation is an essential link between physiology and movement.

To study this, we will analyze electroencephalograms (EEGs) recorded from PD patients under the controlled conditions of an experimental context. The experiment manipulated the level of intrinsic motivation of the patients, on and off medication, while they performed a decision-making task between movements of different motor cost. The resulting dataset was previously analyzed was analyzed by classifying brain states based on local and network dynamics by means of brain source power and Pearson correlation across sources. This study showed that it is possible to identify different brain states related to motivational levels using machine learning techniques.

The main goal of the project here proposed will be identifying and quantifying differences in neural connectivity across brain areas as a function of the person's level of task engagement (motivated state). To this end, we will gain access to the backbone that captures the structure of this classification by using persistent homology. Persistent homology is a basic tool from topological data analysis (TDA) that builds global descriptors of system structure by chronicling the evolution of cavities as one moves through a weighted network.

We will address the following questions:

    1) Are there specific differences between this topological characterization of the data as a function of medication or motivated state?

    2) Our objective is to compute persistent homology features of the EEGs data in different motivational states, to assess differences and homologies that could help explain fundamental differences of the brain network under motivational states and PD.
